# sigbit
Morse code communication over ip networks

SigBit aims to provide a server client architecture implementing the MOPP Morse Over Packet Protocol for CW communication over ip networks.

The ESP_Server variant is designed to run on a ESP microcontroller board.
The script main.py implements a PC client and iambic keyer for use with a hardware iambic paddle. The paddle can be connected to the PC using the serial / COM interface either buildt-in to the computer or via a USB to serial adapter.

# hardware requirements

To interface your key to the computer, you can build a very simple adapter which connects the Pins 4, 6 and 8 t of a DB9 female connector to your paddle contacts via stereo socket or whatever your key requires.

DB9 â€“ 9 Pin Serial Port Connection

DB9		purpose						Stereo connector
Pin 6	manual key or left paddle 	tip
Pin 4	manual key or common 		sleeve
Pin 8	right paddle 				ring

Besides the serial interface, you will need a soundcard for the tones and a network or internet connection.

# software installation

SigBit runs on python3 and requires the following non-standard libraries:

* pyserial
* sounddevice

The easiest way to obtain them is via pip3 install:

on linux run in a shell: 
pip3 install pyserial sounddevice


You may have to adjust some settings in main.py to reflect your available serial port.

key = "/dev/ttyUSB0"

Comon values are /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 or /devtty0, etc. 
On windows it will be something like COM1, COM2, etc.

On linux you need to add your user to the group "dialout"

on linux run in a shell: 
sudo adduser <your_user_name> dialout

Edit the following variables to match your server IP or hostname and port:

server_url = "morse.dyndnss.net"
server_port = 7373


You can then launch the script "main.py" by running from a shell:
python3 main.py


# usage
After launching main.py, you should hear a sidetone if you use your paddle. 

The code is sent to the server but will not be relayed, unless you register sending "HI" (... ..)in morse code. The server will then respond sending "WELCOME" (.-- . .-.. -.-. --- -- .)and you will be able to receive transmissions from all other registered users and to send code to all other connected users. The code is sent automatically as soon as the end of a word is detected.

You are either disconnected by the serer after 30 Minutes of inactivity or you can disconnect by sending ":QRT" (---... --.- .-. -)in morse code. In either case the server will sign off sending "BYE" (-... -.-- .).

# server morse commands
There are some additional server commands, such as activating / deactivation echo mode for testing purposes by sending ":EM" (---... . --). The server will respond by sending you the current state, either "ON" (--- -.) or "OFF" (--- ..-. ..-.). Usually the sending user is excluded from receiving his / her own transmissions. In echo mode, own transmissions are sent back to the sending user as well. This is not suitable for actual communication, but may be helpfull for testing / debugging purposes. Please note that this is a server settign which affects all users.

By sending the command ":USR" (---... ..- ... .-.), the server will report the number of currently active users.

# client morse commands
Note: some of the following commands may not have been implemented, yet

There are a couple of client commands that change some settings on the client side:

"/QRS" (-..-. --.- .-. ...) decreases keyer speed one WPM slower, responds with current speed in WPM.


"/QRQ" (-..-. --.- .-. --.-) increases keyer speed one WPM, responds with current speed in WPM.

"/QTR" (---... --.- - .-.) responds with the current local time.

"/CMD" (---... -.-. -- -..) enter command mode, responds with "cmd?" (-.-. -- -.. ..--..), waits for a command to be entered. Command mode can be left by sending 4 or 8 dits.

in command mode "speed" (... .--. . . -..), responds with "speed?" (... .--. . . -.. ..--..) allows to enter a new two digit keyer speed directely.

If a command or value is wrong, the keyer will respond with "?" (..--..)

# QSO practice
SigBit has been designed in a way to mimick real radio QSOs. Therefore there is no or not much of a user interface appart form your morse key and tone. This mneas, that you have to identify yourself with your callsign as if you where on the radio. Otherwise nobody will know who is talking to who. You can do this the same way as on radio by putting "receipientCallSign DE senderCallSign" at the beginning and the end of your transmissions.
It is good practice to hear for a while after connecting with "HI" to be sure there is no ongoing QSO that could be interrupted. After that you should send a "QRL?" (--.- .-. .-.. ..--..) to ask whether the server is currently in use.
If no one responds, you can call "CQ DE YourCallSign k" a couple of times to see if someone will answer you.
Since the code is transmitted word wise, it is important to wait for the other party to finish their transmission, ending with "K" (-.-) or "KN" (-.- -.) indicating that they are ready to receive.
